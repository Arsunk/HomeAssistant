This readme is a work in progress.  The end goal is to explain what certain sensors are used for and for sensors with more complicated configs, how to understand what is happening.  Hoping this page will lead to people understanding how to setup their own template sensors better and not just copy/paste and ask for help when something doesn't work. 


### Certexpiry.yaml:
This sensor monitors the status of my lets encrypt cert which I then use to receive a notification if its not auto updating.
